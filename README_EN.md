## Temperature-Uart-7.0

## 1. Summary

The Temperature-Uart-7.0 project file creates a temperature control serial assistant based on the communication protocol RS232, using Qt Designer for interface design, pyqt5 for logic refinement, pyserial for serial communication and pyqtgraph for data visualisation.

## 2. Folders by function
- dist folder: holds the executable file where the main file tiny_uart_main.py is packaged.
- doc folder: holds the text content to be displayed by the serial tool.
- ico folder: holds the image backgrounds and related icons that the serial tool needs to use.
- src folder: holds the program code files, including .ui files, .py files and .ini files.
		- .ui files: the interface design files generated by Qt Designer, which generally require the creation of .py files to refine the content
		- .py file: used to refine the .ui file and write the functional code, package the program files and beautify the interface, etc.
		- .ini files: configuration files

## 3. Description
- The logical functions of each program file are separated to ensure that each has its own role to play and to facilitate maintenance later on.
- The use of threads is mainly used for the serial and drawing threads. The plot widget is created in the plot thread to ensure the separation of functions, and the plotting and data processing is done simultaneously and loaded directly into the layout structure in the main file. Because of the multi-threading and the need to keep the threads working together, more pyqtsignal signals are used to pass signals, as explained in the code.
